Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition


Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the supply of energy worldwide. This trend will continue because global energy demand is increasing, and the use of nuclear power and traditional sources of energy such as coal and oil is unsafe and leads to a large amount of CO2 emission. Wind energy is a key player in the field of renewable energy. In Europe, the capacity of wind energy production has doubled from 2009 to 2010.
